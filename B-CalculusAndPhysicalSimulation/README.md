# Calculus and Physical Simulation

## Key Topics

- the study of continuous change
    - rates of change of different quantities
    - what rates of changes can tell us

- **derivative**: taking *cumulative* function and returning *rate*.
- **integral**: reconstruct cumulative function that agrees with rate function
