# 3D Vectors

Since computer screens are 2D, a large portion of the programming involves converting 3D vectors to 2D vectors that give the illusion of 3D.

3D objects are primarily made up of a collection of triangles.

2D Vectors are living in the 3D space, fixed to a plane. The following components exist in 3D and are part of 2D:
- origin
- x-axis
- y-axis
- arrow
- point

Through the *z* axis we can add the third dimension, also known as depth.

## Important

Matplotlib is used gain, with 3D wrappers:
- `Points3D`
- `Arrow3D`
- `draw3d` (render objects & 3d space box)
