# Goal
- starting with vector space
- find smaller spaces with fewer dimensions

An example of this is converting a colored image to black and white.
The black and white picture is a 900-dimension subspace in the original colored 270,000-dimensional space.

# Vector Subspace
- a vector space that exists inside another vector space.
e.g. A 2D plane within a 3D space.
