All answers to this chapter can be found in the `../individualProject.docx` file.
All notable vector drawings can be seen by running the `./vectors_ex.py` file with Anaconda (see root directory README).

## Key Points
Vectors: *Objects that live in multi-dimensional spaces.*
    - origin: *reference point*
    - represented: e.g.*(3, 7)*
    - contain 'tips' and 'tails'
2D Space: A *plane* contains:
    - height
    - width
Pythagorean Theorem: *For right-angled triangles, can be used to find side lengths.*
    - `a^2 + b^2 = c^2`
