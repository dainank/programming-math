# Theory
All answers to this chapter can be found in the `../individualProject.docx` file.
All notable vector drawings can be seen by running the `./vectors_ex.py` file with Anaconda (see root directory README).

## Key Points
Vectors: *Objects that live in multi-dimensional spaces.*
- origin: *reference point*
- represented: e.g.*(3, 7)*
- contain 'tips' and 'tails'

2D Space: A *plane* contains:
- height
- width

Pythagorean Theorem: *For right-angled triangles, can be used to find side lengths.*
    - `a^2 + b^2 = c^2`

*Trigonometric functions* are used for *angles* in planes:
- angles have *constant* ratios
- `tan()` can be used to find missing lengths [and `sine()` && `cosine()`]:
  - `tan(37°) ≈ ¾`
- `1 radian ≈ 57.296°`
- `π radians = 180°`

Polar Vector: `(3, 60°)`
Cartesian Vector: `(0, 2, 6)` (can also be 2 dimensions)

Inverse Trig Functions:
    - arcsine
    - arccosine
    - arctangent
