# Maths with Programming
Learning and practicing maths through coding (Python). The repository contains several folders each with little exercises and programs that represent mathematical topics. Non-coding-related exercises can be found in the documentation handed in on Canvas. Please be aware that the structure, code, and implementations are very experimental thus many sections of this repository may contain no documentation, broken methods, or repeated code as I mess around with the different topics.

## Topics

- Vector geometry for computer graphics
- Matrices and linear transformations
- Core concepts from calculus
- Simulation and optimization
- Image and audio processing
- Machine learning algorithms for regression and classification

## Setting Up Dev Environment For This Repository
