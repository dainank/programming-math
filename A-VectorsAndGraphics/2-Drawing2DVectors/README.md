# 2 - Drawing 2D Vectors
## Key Concepts
- coordinates are often ordered as *ordered pair (tuple)*

## Classes
| Class     | Example Constructor   | Description                                       |
| --------- | --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| Polygon   | `Polygon(*vectors)`     | Draws polygon through list of vectors             |
| Points    | `Points(*vectors)`      | Draws list of points                              |
| Arrow     | `Arrow(tip, tail)`      | Draws arrow, tail is optional (defaults origin)   |
| Segment   | `Segment(start,end)`    | Draw line segment with two points                 |
