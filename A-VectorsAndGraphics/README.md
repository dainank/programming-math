# Part 1 - Vectors and Graphics\
See individual chapters for answers to questions, completion of mini-projects and implementation of code (**proof of work**).

## Key Concepts (notes)
- **plane**:
    - a 2D space
    - points in a plane require the origin reference point
- **vector:**
    - the position of one point in space relative to another (usually origin)
    - a straight arrow in the plane
    - data point in multi-dimensional space
    - points in a plane
        - (x, y), (x, y, z), e.t.c.
- **linear transformation:**
    - a function that takes vector as input and returns vector as output while preserving geometry
        - e.g. vectors all lying on straight line will still lie on straight line post-transformation
- **matrices:**
    - rectangular arrays of numbers that can represent linear transformations
