# 3D Vectors

Since computer screens are 2D, a large portion of the programming involves converting 3D vectors to 2D vectors that give the illusion of 3D.

3D objects are primarily made up of a collection of triangles.

2D Vectors are living in the 3D space, fixed to a plane. The following components exist in 3D and are part of 2D:
- origin
- x-axis
- y-axis
- arrow
- point

Through the *z* axis we can add the third dimension, also known as depth.

See `length_vector.png` in `./3d-vectors` for finding the length of a 3d vector.

Two angles are required to specify direction in 3D:
- ϕ (phi) [first angle, makes with 'x']
- θ (theta) [second angle, makes with 'z']
*these are known as **spherical coordinates**, but we use **vector products** usually for calculations.*

## Important

Exercises can be found in the `ex.py` file.

Matplotlib is used gain, with 3D wrappers:
- `Points3D`
- `Arrow3D`
- `draw3d` (render objects & 3d space box)
